                    <em>Solar System</em>
                    has one star, eight planets, five officially recognized dwarf planets, at least
                    <em>290 moons</em>, more than 
                    <em>1.3 million asteroids</em> , and about 
                    <em>3,900 comets</em>.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It is located in an outer spiral arm of the 
                    <em>Milky Way galaxy</em>  called the 
                    <em>Orion Arm</em>, or 
                    <em>Orion Spur</em>. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 
                    <em>515,000 mph (828,000 kph)</em>. It takes about 
                    <em>230 million years</em> to complete one orbit around the galactic center.

                    We call it the solar system because it is made up of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets
                    <em>Mercury</em>,
                    <em> Venus</em>,
                    <em> Earth</em>,
                    <em> Mars</em>,
                    <em> Jupiter</em>,
                    <em> Saturn</em>,
                    <em> Uranus</em>, and
                    <em> Neptune</em>;
                    dwarf planets
                    <em>Pluto</em>,
                    <em> Ceres</em>,
                    <em> Makemake</em>,
                    <em> Haumea</em>, and
                    <em> Eris</em> – along with hundreds of moons; and <em>millions of asteroids</em>, <em> comets</em> and
                    <em> meteoroids</em>.

                    Our solar system is the
                    <em>only one we know</em> of that has a planet
                    <em>that supports life</em>. So far, we only know of
                    <em>life on Earth,</em>
                    but we’re looking for life on other worlds.
